# DTU - Process Science Lab

The DTU Process Science Lab (PSL) is an initiative organized by faculty members of the [Software Systems Engineering](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/software-systems-engineering) section of [DTU Compute](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/).
The ultimate goal of the lab is to coordinate research activities involving Process Science (including Process Mining and BPM). More specifically, the goal of the lab is:

<center>
    *To model and monitor human-centric and flexible processes using data-driven techniques providing verifiable and explainable outcomes.*
</center>

To achieve this goal, the lab leverages techniques stemming from formal methods, data science, software engineering and information systems.
